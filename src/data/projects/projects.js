    description:
      "In this project, I developed a dynamic web page for the website of an interior designer using JavaScript and interacting with an API. I worked on the Front-End, creating a presentation page for the designer’s work using the provided HTML. The project involved handling user events and manipulating DOM elements with JavaScript. Additionally, I built an admin login page and a modal for uploading new media. For the first time, I worked with back-end code to test the features, learning how to interact with an API, a key skill for modern web development. I used Figma for the designs, Visual Studio Code for development, and GitHub for version control.",
